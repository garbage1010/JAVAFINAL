Ugh… I wonder why I even TRY to teach. NONE of my pre-calculus students showed up today. 
Where the hell could they have even gone? None of them are seniors, so it couldn’t have been a senior prank. 
…
My computer science kids aren’t any better. Three of them turned in papers with the FRINGES on them. It’s driving me nuts… I’m going to fix and grade them. 
Okay, let’s see here…
How the hell did he not catch that?
That’s gonna cost her the A she had in this class…
Last one.
This one is forigivable, I guess. I’ll only take off half.
Home time. I’m gonna open the safe to get my keys.
AAaaand the door is locked.
Off to my next task.
Hey, Mr. Landa! I need help on my Calculus homework… 
Okay. Let me see.
Thanks!
No shame in asking for help.
Mr. Landa! Mr. Landa!
What?
My program keeps saying “SyntaxError: missing curly bracket”. Can you fix it?
THIS is why I tell you to comment them. THIS.
Sorry… All you need to do is type in the number of the line where the bracket is missing.
The tech guys in the library asked me to see if I could fix the problem with the servers. They think something’s broken. 
What the… 
This is a cipher! Let’s see if I can crack this. 
That was… somewhat difficult. Whatever. I think it solved the issue, so…
WHAT THE FU-
I need to get out of here. NOW! 
Damn… I’m gonna have to jump-! 
Ugh, what happene- 
Right! That THING is chasing me. 
I need to get in that car. 
Lovely… another cipher. 
CRAP! I need to do something- RIGHT NOW!
