That was close. I need to find out what the hell is going on. 
This GPS here has coordinates... I'm going. 
Okay, I'm here. 
Is this a laboratory? 
Better check it out. 
Those portraits look like my students! 
Oh my God. This is straight out of a horror movie! 
I need to grab the right syringe to save these kids.
WHAT- HOW DID IT FIND ME?! 
Iâ€™m ending this.
