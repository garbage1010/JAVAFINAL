Hey, Mr. Landa! I need help on my Calculus homework… 
Okay. Let me see.
Thanks!
No shame in asking for help.
Mr. Landa! Mr. Landa!
What?
My program keeps saying “SyntaxError: missing curly bracket”. Can you fix it?
THIS is why I tell you to comment them. THIS.
Sorry… 
All you need to do is type in the number of the line where the bracket is missing.
